            Endpoint for registering a new client. The endpoint requires
            authentication with valid i3-MARKET credentials.


            {data} refers to a compact JWE encrypted with this server's public
            key with the following payload:


            ```json

            {
              did: string
              username: string
              authkey: string
            }

            ```


            - `did` is the did of the user. The required authorization forces
            the user to prove that is the owner of this `did`

            - `username` is a unique username proposed by the client (it should
            be able to memorize it)

            - `authkey` is a secret securely derived from the user's password,
            so can be recovered if the user remembers the password. `authkey`
            will work as a standard password server side.

            The "kid" (key ID) parameter is used to match a specific key. This

            Set during key rollover.  The structure of the "kid" value is
            unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
            keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  (One
            example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value is if
            they have different "kty" (key type) values but are considered to be
            equivalent alternatives by the application using them.) The "kid"
            value is a case-sensitive string. When used with JWS or JWE, the
            "kid" value is used to match a JWS or JWE "kid" Header Parameter
